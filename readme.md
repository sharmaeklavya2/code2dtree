# Code to Decision Tree

Convert a python function to a decision tree.

Run `python selectionSort.py 3` to get a decision tree for
the [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) algorithm
when the input is a list of length 3.
Read `selectionSort.py` to see how to use `code2dtree`.

`code2dtree` contains type annotations. It passes the `mypy --strict` check.
